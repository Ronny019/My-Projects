We're looking for current undergrad/grad STEM students so if you're a STEM student or know STEM students, I would greatly appreciate if you can help take or pass along this short survey.

While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like \"you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention\" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60\\'s.'\n",

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment. We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder â€“ you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires. The questionnaires will only take about 10 minutes to complete online. For your participation, weâ€™ll donate Â£1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child & Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink).\"\n",

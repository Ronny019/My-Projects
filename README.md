#### My-Projects ####

### The Projects in this Repo are: ###

**A- MyDataSetModels- The datasets are available in the respective folders**

1. Regression Model on Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) - To run this program call "**python CCPP_SVM.py**" . The other files are just for reference and contain my other approaches to solve this problem.

2. Regression Model on Combined Cycle Power Plant (Wheat) - First call "**python clean_tsv_file.py**", to preprocess the data and generate a clean csv file. Then call "python wheat_knn.py" . The other files show my other approaches for modelling the classfier.

3. Twitter Analysis of Restaurants (TwitterRestaurantAnanlysis) - Call "**python restaurant_tweets.py**". The model building is done in the file natural_language_processing.py . Before running make sure you have you have the API Secret Keys and access tokens to use the twython API in the appropriate places as indicated in the file restaurant_tweets.py.

4. Prediction of Covid-19 Cases in India (Covid19_India) - Call "**python Covid19_India.py**"

5. Classification of Images of Pokemons (Pokemon_Classification) - Contains the jupyter notebook of classification of images of pokemon. The dataset used contains 4 pokemons. Make sure the file 4_pokemons.zip is present at the directory **./tmp/** . The file can be found at **https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I7-3NUBpEQDPo5dwyihiH9WDq5fJ67nA/view?usp=sharing** It is recommended to run this in a system with GPU support of tensorflow. the two notebooks contain my two different architectures I have used to solve the problem.

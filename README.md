### The Projects in this Repo are: ###

**A- MyDataSetModels- The datasets are available in the respective folders**

1. Regression Model on Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) - To run this program call "python CCPP_SVM.py" . The other files are just for reference and contain my other approaches to solve this problem.

2. Regression Model on Combined Cycle Power Plant (Wheat) - First call "python clean_tsv_file.py", to preprocess the data and generate a clean csv file. Then call "python wheat_knn.py" . The other files show my other approaches for modelling the classfier.

3. Twitter Analysis of Restaurants (TwitterRestaurantAnanlysis) - Call "python restaurant_tweets.py". The model building is done in the file natural_language_processing.py . Before running make sure you have you have the API Secret Keys and access tokens to use the twython API in the appropriate places as indicated in the file restaurant_tweets.py.
